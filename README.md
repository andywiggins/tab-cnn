### Guitar Tablature Estimation with a Convolutional Neural Network

###### This code supports the paper "Guitar Tablature Estimation with a Convolutional Neural Network" that will be presented at the 20th Conference of the International Society for Music Information Retreival (ISMIR 2019).

To visualize the system performance, `tab-cnn/demos/` contains video demonstrations showing predicted and ground truth tablature synced with input audio. To run the code, follow the instructions below.

### 0. Requirements

This project was made to be run with Python 3.9.7. You should have the following libraries/packages installed:
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* jams
* librosa
* keras
* tensorflow

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 1. Download dataset

Download the GuitarSet audio and annotation data from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1422265/files/GuitarSet_audio_and_annotation.zip?download=1 "GuitarSet download"). (Thanks again to the authors for creating this awesome dataset!)

Unzip and place the downloaded GuitarSet folder in `tab-cnn/data/` so that in `tab-cnn/data/GuitarSet/` you have the following two folders:
* `annotation/`
* `audio/`

The remaining instructions assume that you are in the `tab-cnn/` folder.

### 2. Preprocess audio

Run the following line to preprocess different spectral representations for the audio files: 

  `bash data/Bash_TabDataReprGen.sh`

This will save the preprocessed data as compressed numpy (.npz) files in the `data/spec_repr/` directory.

### 3. (Optional) Set spectral representation

The default spectral spresentation is the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). To change representations, an argument can be added when creating the TabCNN object. Specifically, on line 193 in `model/TabCNN.py`, a `spec_repr` parameter can be set to one of the following:
* `spec_repr = "c"`, for CQT
* `spec_repr = "m"`, for Mel-scaled spectrogram (Melspec)
* `spec_repr = "cm"`, for CQT + Melspec concatenation
* `spec_repr = "s"`, for Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT)

### 4. Train and test model

Run the following line to train and test the TabCNN model:

`python model/TabCNN.py`

A summary log and a csv results file will be saved in a time-stamped folder within the `model/saved/` directory. Additionally, a folder for each fold of data will be created, containing the individual model's weights and predictions.
